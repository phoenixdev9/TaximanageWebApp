Web aplication developed as practical part of my Bachelor's thesis. Implemented using Nextjs with Typescript as fullstack technology and QuestDB as database. Focus of the project is displaying QuestDB's performances and features when working with large amounts of time series data. Consists of historical rides data as well as real time taxi rides ingestion and displaying.
